**Overview:**\
NGO Adobe House prioritizes safeguarding user assets and data.&#x20;

Our multi-faceted security approach, anchored by rigorous standards and protocols, ensures robust protection against potential threats.

**Smart Contract Excellence:**\
We developed our token and presale smart contracts through meticulous collaboration with domain experts. This rigorous process ensured each code line met high security and functionality benchmarks, establishing trust and reliability.

**Asset Protection:**\
To minimize exposure to online risks, we securely hold a significant portion of funds not immediately required in cold storage. This approach underscores our commitment to asset safety.

**ICO Presale Security:**\
During the ICO presale phase, we implemented maximum SSL encryption to secure payment information. This advanced encryption ensures that transaction data remains confidential and shielded from potential breaches.

**Future-Proofing Security:**\
As we develop our educational platform, we're embedding robust security measures:

* **End-to-End Encryption:** To ensure user data remains confidential.
* **Proactive Security Updates:** Regular updates to respond to the evolving digital threat landscape.
* **DDoS Resilience:** Implementing measures to counteract Distributed Denial of Service attacks, maintaining uninterrupted platform access.
* **Enhanced User Security:** Strategizing the integration of two-factor authentication (2FA) for fortified user account protection.

**Unwavering Privacy Commitment:**\
User privacy is at the heart of NGO Adobe House. Our data collection and storage strictly align with our comprehensive privacy policy, ensuring transparency and trust. Sharing user data with third parties without informed consent is non-negotiable.
