Token Contract Functions

Basic Token Operations

- balanceOf(account): Returns the balance of a specified account.
- transfer(recipient, amount): Transfers tokens from the caller's account to the recipient's account.
- allowance(ownerAddr, spender): Returns the remaining allowance for a spender to spend on behalf of an owner.
- approve(spender, amount): Approves a spender to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.
- transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount): Transfers tokens from the sender to the recipient using the allowance mechanism.

Staking Integration

- setStakingContract(_stakingContract): Sets the address of the staking contract.
- stakeTokens(amount): Stakes a specified amount of tokens.
- unstakeTokens(): Unstakes tokens from the staking contract.
- generateReward(amount): Generates reward tokens for the caller.

Contract Upgrade Management

AdobeHouse has designed its token smart contract with the ability to be upgraded. The decision to update the smart contract is to ensure that we can incorporate new features, enhance security measures, and improve the overall efficiency of the token ecosystem. As we progress with our educational platform and community, we may identify areas for refinement or additions to the contract that can better support our mission.

The upgrade process will be thoroughly tested and audited to maintain the highest level of security and transparency. We are committed to keeping our community informed about any updates to the smart contract.

How to Interact with the Contract

To interact with the AdobeHouse smart contract, use digital wallets like MetaMask or directly interact with the contract address. For staking and unstaking tokens, refer to the specific functions detailed above.

Important Note

Please note that the AdobeHouse token smart contract is designed with the ability to be upgraded. We may release new versions to enhance security, efficiency, and functionality, which will be communicated to the community.

Always verify the contract address and functions before interacting with it, as it may be subject to audits and ongoing updates.
