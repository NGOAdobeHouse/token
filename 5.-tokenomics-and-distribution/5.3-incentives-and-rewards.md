# 5.3 Incentives and Rewards

Our token system is built on the principle of rewarding engagement, loyalty, and contribution:

* **Children:** Young learners receive tokens as rewards, which can be used to access advanced learning materials.
* **Teachers and Content Creators:** Both educators and individuals can earn through content creation. Quality content, once approved, can be monetized, creating a win-win for creators and the platform.
* **Stakers:** Users staking tokens benefit from a fixed revenue model initially. As the platform evolves, stakers will transition to Layer 2 rewards, earning a portion of the trading fees. This dual-phase approach ensures long-term engagement and loyalty.
* **Community Engagement:** Through airdrops and contests during the ICO phase, we aim to foster a strong and vibrant community. These rewards not only promote platform awareness but also encourage active participation from the onset.
